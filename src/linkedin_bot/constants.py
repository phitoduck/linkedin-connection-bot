Hi!\n

This is Eric's Python bot üë®‚Äçüíª üêç\n

I'm at the connection limit, so I've actually stopped accepting connection requests from people I don't know in real life (yet).\n

Would you please follow me if we don't know each other?\n

I try to do a phone call to meet someone every day on my drive home from work. We can do one if you like :D\n

If you care to see the code that is currently spamming you... it's here! https://github.com/phitoduck/linkedin-connection-bot\n

Nice to meet you,\n

Eric
